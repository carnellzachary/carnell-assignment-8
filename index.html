	<h2>A Significant Racial Disparity</h2>

	<p>One might be inclined to assume that the “hate” in hate crimes refers to anger or dislike. But that is not the case. A hate crime is defined by the U.S. Department of Justice as a crime “committed on the basis of the victim’s perceived or actual race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or disability.” Whether the offender was angry or not, if a crime was committed on the basis of one or more of those categories, then it constitutes a hate crime. </p>

	<p>Data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Census Bureau reveals a significant racial disparity among hate crimes.</p>

	<p>Although black or African American people made up 13.7% of the U.S. population in 2020, they were the victims of hate crimes in 57.3% of instances. Moreover, white people were the victims of hate crimes only 15.7% of the time even though they made up 57.6% of the population in 2020.</p>
